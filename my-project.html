				<h2>About me</h2>
	
					<p>Matteo Spanu<br>Milano, 26/05/1982</p>
					<p>My 13+ years working experience created a background that is probably different from what you are used to read: believing - wrongly - that my passion for tecnology wasn’t meant to be a profession, I worked all my life as a Physiotherapist. <br> During lockdown I had the chance to experience second-hand the master “UX Design Essencial”, attended by my partner. <b>This has been a wake up call which boosted my inner desire of pursuing a career in the digital world and made me rethink about the life choices I made so far.</b> <br> As unorthodox as it can be to change profession at the age of 38 in Italy, I decided to get out of my comfort zone and give it a try. I believe my personality is on my side and this is what I was meant to be in the first place.

					<p>I realise that being <i>“the old guy”</i> in a very young world is not easy, but it has its perks: many working years made me a very reliable person, who can handle responsabilities. At the same time I am humble and eager to learn not only <b>as much</b> as I can, but also <b>as better</b> as I can. I believe that can make a difference. <br>  Moreover, practicing basketball for many years made me a team player and I find very motivating to share the work experience with a team, for better and for worse. <br> I want to prove the young me wrong and believe that a passion can turn into a profession, even in an unexpected time of my life.

        		<h2>Goals</h2>
        			<p>In three years, I aim to be part of a company where I can develop my skills and become a professional in this whole new path I’d like to create for myself. I would like to be part of a team where I can find colleagues to learn from and to grow with. Ideally, I’d work in the medical environment where my background as helthcare professional could be an added value. I always had an interest in technology that grew into a passion. Now my goal is to let it grow into a career.</p>

				<h2>Why</h2>
				<h4>The reasons why I’m applying to CodeMaster at Talent Garden would be the following:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Although being stuck in the status quo is easy, I strogly believe that getting out of the comfort zone and listen to the gut will pay off eventually. So this is what I’m trying to do by applying to this course.
						</li>
						<li>I think I fit in this world. Looking back and analysing my skills and my personality, I realised that being a developer is the right profession for me: I’m precise, reliable and very organized, with an analitycal mindset. I’m a focused, goal driven person and, in order to reach that goal in the best way possible, I always give more than 100%. I’m highly motivated and I never get fed up with practicing.
						</li>
						<li>I’m aware of the difficulties of changing career path at 38, but I do think that at Talent Garden I can have the possibility to prove myself by working with professionals, having the possibilty to build a network and find my way into this world.
						</li>
					</ul>
